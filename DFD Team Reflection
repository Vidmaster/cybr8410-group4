For this Data Flow Diagram (DFD) project, the team completed the videos and quiz earlier, so that we could spend more time focusing on the content of the project. 
We used the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool to create our DFDs and quickly noticed that unlike the Lucid Chart application, the TMT app did not allow multi-user collaboration.  We overcame this limitation by Zipping our files and sharing them via Slack. This allowed the team to build on each other’s work without wasting time re-drawing the same models.
We had a productive team meeting prior to this project’s meeting with the instructor. This was a major benefit because we were able to receive valuable feedback from our instructor about some of our initial DFDs, and that helped us move forward with a better idea of how to model the addition DFDs required of the project.
Our teamwork continues to improve with each project, and we are able to quickly adapt in order to accommodate when team members have personal issues to overcome during the project. As in previous projects, we have had members taking care of family members and covering extra shifts at work due to COVID-19 quarantines.
