## Teamwork Reflection
Based on what we learned on the last assignment, we started working on this together to give our group a better sense of how this project needed to be done. After meeting with the professor we found that we were going into to much depth on some of the cases, and should focus more closely on claims that are appropriate to make about Spring Security and its capabilities. What we had done was correct but we were making it to hard on ourselves by making broad claims about the system rather than more specific ones around Spring Security. As with the last assignment we had to work around our jobs again, this has been a issue with Bryan as he has had to work late hours multiple times. Bob needed family time over the weekend, and worked hard to get a lot of the claim work done before he left. Henry also had issues with work this week and is taking care of his injured dog.

Overall our teamwork felt improved on this assignment, with our main challenges being externally motivated and difficult to anticipate. As usual, the team has done a good job of picking up each other's slack where necessary. Our goal for next assignment is to get the team through the lectures and quiz earlier so our first team meeting can be more productive, and the second one can be used to finalize details. Currently we've had to cancel or cut short several of the early meetings because the majority of the team hasn't gone far enough on the module to have a discussion around the assignment, but we're also unable to easily move the meeting due to everyone's scheduling constraints.
